:FeatureName: Argo CD application sets in non-control plane namespaces
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

By using application sets, you can automate and manage the deployments of multiple Argo CD applications declaratively from a single mono-repository to many clusters at once with greater flexibility.

With {gitops-title} 1.12 and later, you can manage the `ApplicationSet` resources in non-control plane namespaces by explicitly enabling and configuring the `ArgoCD` and `ApplicationSet` custom resources (CRs) as per your requirements. This functionality is particularly useful in multitenancy environments when you want to manage deployments of Argo CD applications for your isolated teams.

[NOTE]
====
The generated Argo CD applications can create resources in any non-control plane namespace. However, the application itself will be in the same namespace as the application set resources.
